# Chaskiq

### A Rails engine to send newsletters.

![](./chaskiq-admin.png)


<p>The <i><b>Chasquis</b></i> (also <i><b>Chaskiq (Quechua word)</b></i>) were agile and highly trained runners that delivered messages royal delicacies such as fish and other objects throughout the Inca Empire, principally in the service of the Sapa Inca.</p>

### Motivation.

I really don't like the idea of paying ~50USD/mo to send a simple newsletter, I find that commercial alternatives are really awesome, but those solutions have nothing that the OS community can't achieve.

### How it works.

Chaskiq works with Amazon SES to send mails and Amazon SNS service to get the bounces & complaints. The SNS integration is optional but recommended in order to get those features.

#### Features:

+ Email template editor out of the box.
+ Mustache tags enables use of variables in templates.
+ Reusable templates.
+ Reusable email lists.
+ Tracks opens and clicks.
+ Tracks bounces and complaints (via AWS SNS).
+ Displays reports on:
  + % of deliveries.
  + clicks, opens, bounces, complaints.
  + Detail list of who opens, clicks, bounces & complains.

### How to install:

Use chaskiq as a gem in a rails project.

+ `gem 'chaskiq'` in your `Gemfile` and execute `bundle install`
+ `rails generate chaskiq:install` will add an initializer, route & migrations
+ `rake db:migrate`

+ config/initializers/active_job.rb
  ```ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter = :sidekiq```

### Secure system:

You can use any authentication system, just configure the Chaskiq authentication method for controllers.

Assuming you are using Devise, to protect the admin paths you will use the Devise `authenticate_*!` method for controllers as is.

In `config/initializers/chaskiq.rb`:

```ruby
Chaskiq::Config.setup do |config|
  config.authentication_method = :authenticate_user!
end
```

# TODO:
- [ ] API support.
- [ ] more insightful reporting
- [ ] scheduled deliveries via (sidetiq or whenever).
- [ ] send to many lists in one campaign and send to list segments (like mailchimp).
